# Project Title: Foodie Adventurer Server

"Foodie Adventurer" is a restaurant website that offers a variety of Indian cuisine. The website features a homepage with different types of food offered to easily find desired dishes and chefs. Users can browse through the chefs' profiles and view their number of years of experience, number of recipes, likes, and their picture. Users can also view the ingredients and instructions for each recipe, and add their favorite recipes to a favorite list.

The website is built using React.js for frontend, backend used Node Js on the top of the Express JS framework and Firebase for authentication purposes, and features authentication for users to create and manage their account information. The website is fully responsive, allowing users to easily access and navigate the site from their mobile devices.

The chefs featured on the website are all Indian, providing a unique cultural experience for users to learn more about Indian cuisine and cooking. Overall, "Foodie Adventurer" offers a convenient and enjoyable way to explore and learn about Indian cuisine.

## Features of this Project
- For server making i used NodeJs on the top of Express Js for make the server easily. We Know,  Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write server-side code using the same language as they use for client-side code. Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. Using Express.js with Node.js allows for efficient development, as well as the ability to easily scale and maintain applications.

- Also, some packages were used to quickly set up this server, such as CORS, Nodemon, and Concurrently, which allows for running both the server and client simultaneously.

- Also used express json middleware.

## Routes
- In this project, I created five routes, one being the default route and the others being specific path routes.
